# Synopsis

Big City meets the Big Pop! In a mere moment, when the Great Pop hit, the Old World disappeared and the player, as well as the rest of the world around them, have forgotten who they are and how the world worked. All that is left is the grasp of language, and it is up to the player to negotiate with the people they find around them the ultimate question: "How do we want to live together?"

The Utopian Dialogue is a browser-rendered text based adventure game which asks the player to consider utopia, balancing the needs and interpreations of the other characters whom they meet in this new and yet familiar world. The actions of the player will shape how the world is, who they are and develop the characters around them
